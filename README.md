**Pro Tip**: Use the `/` shortcut to quickly access the console, then type your commands: 
Press `/` then type `a todo "Review project requirements"`

**Delete Items**: Since items no longer have delete buttons, use the console: `/rm todo "item name"`

**Smart Suggestions Example**: If you have an item called "hello world" in your todo list, typing `rm todo h` will suggest `rm todo hello world`

**Description Interaction**: Each item shows a description in gray text (limited to 4 lines). Click directly on this text to edit it inline - text becomes black and scrollable if longer than 4 lines. No popup boxes needed - just click, type, and press Enter to save.

Happy productivity! üéâ
